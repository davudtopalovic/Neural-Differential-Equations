# Neural-Differential-Equations
Neural Differential Equations for Time Series Analysis

At this repository you can find the code that implements the Neural Differential Equation algorithm. The code is commented in detail. Also you can check my report on Neural ODEs where I describe the idea, intuition, and math behind the algorithm.
